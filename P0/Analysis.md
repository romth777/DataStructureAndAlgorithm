## Big O analysis
 * Task 0: O(1); There are no loops to run. The data is in the list and just get by O(1).
 * Task 1: O(N); There is one loop to seek all the data. The data is in the set and add with O(1) in the average case.
 * Task 2: O(N); There is one loop to seek all the data. The data is in the dict and get with O(1) in the average case.
 * Task 3: O(NlogN); There is one loop to seek all the data and sorted by NlogN algorithm. The data is in the list and just get by O(1).
 * Task 4: O(NlogN); There is one loop to seek all the data and sorted by NlogN algorithm. The data is in the list and just get by O(1).

# Problem 5
## Abstract
I implemented blockchain model using linked list.
The explanation of blockchain is below.
>A Blockchain is a sequential chain of records, similar to a linked list. Each block contains some information and how it is connected related to the other blocks in the chain. 

## Data structure
I used linked list for implementing blockchain model, linked list is constructed by nodes which includes information and hashes and link of next node and so on.

## Time analysis
The time order is O(1) to add block to blockchain model with given list.
The search order is O(N) to get a desired node where N is the size of blockchain.

## Space analysis
The space order is O(N) for blockchain tree.

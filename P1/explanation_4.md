# Problem 4
## Abstract
I implemented whether if the user in group including sub grops.

## Data structure
I used list for implementing pooling of groups.
This style is same as problem 2 and it is like a DFS algorithm.

## Time analysis
The time order is O(logD) where D is the maximum depth of directories.

## Space analysis
The space order is O(D) where D is the maximum depth of directories.

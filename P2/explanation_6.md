# Problem 6: Max and Min in a Unsorted Array
## Abstract
>In this problem, we will look for smallest and largest integer from a list of unsorted integers.

I solve this problem with one loop.

## Data structure
There is no need to use specific data structure in this task by using binary search.
However, an array is given.

## Algorithm
I used one for loop for seeking array and update max and min value with iteration.

## Time analysis
Required time complexity is O(N) where N is size of array, and my implementation is on it.

## Space analysis
Space complexity is O(N) for given array.

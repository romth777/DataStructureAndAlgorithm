# Problem 3: Rearrange Array Elements
## Abstract
>Rearrange Array Elements so as to form two number such that their sum is maximum. Return these two numbers.

I solve this problem with sort and one loop.

## Data structure
There is no need to use specific data structure in this task by using binary search.
However, an array is given.

## Algorithm
I solved this task with one for loop.
The strategy of this task is stack high digit from bigger number using max and min item in the input list so no need to sort array.

## Time analysis
Required time complexity is O(N) for get max and min item of input list where N is size of array and one for loop for these range, and my implementation is on it.

## Space analysis
Space complexity is O(N) for given array.

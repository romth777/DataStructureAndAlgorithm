# Problem 3: Rearrange Array Elements
## Abstract
>Rearrange Array Elements so as to form two number such that their sum is maximum. Return these two numbers.

I solve this problem with sort and one loop.

## Data structure
There is no need to use specific data structure in this task by using binary search.
However, an array is given.

## Algorithm
I solved this task with sort and one loop.
The strategy of this task is stack high digit from bigger number, so I need to sort an given array.

## Time analysis
Required time complexity is O(NlogN) where N is size of array, and my implementation is on it.

## Space analysis
Space complexity is O(N) for given array.

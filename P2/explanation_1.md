# Problem 1: Square Root of an Integer
## Abstract
I implemented finding the square root of an integer with binary search algorithm.

## Data structure
There is no need to use specific data structure in this task by using binary search.

## Algorithm
I used binary search algorithm for this task because the required time complexity is O(logN) where N is an target integer.
Binary search algorithm can search given sorted list with O(logN).
In this task my strategy of finding the square root is to search numbers from 0 to target integer thus binary search can work.

## Time analysis
Required time complexity is O(logN), and my implementation is on it.

## Space analysis
Space complexity is O(1), there is no need to save another data.

# Problem 4: Dutch National Flag Problem
## Abstract
>Given an input array consisting on only 0, 1, and 2, sort the array in a single traversal.

I solve this problem with OrderedDict for counting and reconstruct array.

## Data structure
An array is given, and I used OrderedDict for counting the number of 0, 1, and 2.

## Algorithm
I solved this task with counting and reconstruction of array.

## Time analysis
Required time complexity is O(N) where N is size of array, and my implementation is on it.

## Space analysis
Space complexity is O(N) for given array and OrderedDict.
